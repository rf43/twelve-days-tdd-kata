# twelve-days-tdd-kata
A friend of mine posted this TDD kata the other day and I thought it was interesting. I thought it would be neat to do this in a few different languages (maybe lol)

The instructions can be found at [Samman Technical Coaching: Twelve Days of Christmas Song](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/christmas_song.html)

# Twelve Days of Christmas Song

- Write a small program that outputs the full lyrics of the carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas". 
- You must reproduce the words in the correct order. 
- The case, format, and punctuation should be suitable for a carol singer to use, similar to the example below.
- Must use Test Driven Development (TDD)
  - In other words, must include tests

## Notes

By "small" we mean the program should not include the entire text of the lyrics or read a file that contains them.

This is not meant to be the _smallest_ code (eg. code golf) but focused more on what potential "production"-level, tested code might look like

## Lyrics

The lyrics are as follows:

```

My true love sent to me:
A partridge in a pear tree.
